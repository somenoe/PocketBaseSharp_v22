## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to [**PRCV1** for creating the original PocketBase C# SDK](https://github.com/PRCV1/pocketbase-csharp-sdk) and laying the groundwork for this project. His excellent work made this continuation possible.

This fork exists with his approval.

## Installation

**Structure:**

- PocketBaseSharp (The SDK)
- PocketBaseSharp.Tests
- PocketBase (Database & windows binary)

**Running PocketBase:**

- Open `\PocketBase\pocketbase.exe` in terminal and run the following
  command to start the PocketBase instance: `pocketbase.exe serve`
- Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/` to access the database directly

**Pocketbase admin login:**
Email: `admin@admin.com`
PW: `demo123456`

**Using the SDK:**

- Add PocketSharpSDK to your solution
- Add PocketSharpSDK to your project as a reference
- _Nuget package coming in the future_

## Getting Started

using PocketBaseSharp;

Create a new client which connects to your PocketBase API

    var client = new PocketBase("http://127.0.0.1:8090");

Authenticate as an Admin

    var admin = await client.Admin.AuthWithPasswordAsync("admin@admin.com", "demo123456");

Or as a User

    var user = await client.User.AuthWithPasswordAsync("admin@admin.com", "demo1234");

Query some data (for example, some ToDo items)
Note: Each CRUD action requires a data type which inherits from the base class 'BaseModel'.

    var restaurantList = await client.Collection("todos").GetFullListAsync<todos>();

Manage backups (Admin only)

    // Create a new backup
    var result = await client.Backup.CreateAsync("my-backup.zip");

    // List all backups
    var backups = await client.Backup.GetFullListAsync();

    // Download a backup
    var stream = await client.Backup.DownloadAsync("my-backup.zip");

    // Restore from backup (⚠️ Destructive - replaces current database)
    await client.Backup.RestoreAsync("my-backup.zip");
    (not functional when pocketbase is hosted by windows. Will work with Linux though.

    // Delete a backup
    await client.Backup.DeleteAsync("my-backup.zip");
